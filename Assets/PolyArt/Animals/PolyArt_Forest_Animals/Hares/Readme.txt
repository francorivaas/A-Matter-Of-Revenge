Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
 Animator is missing. 
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- attack 1 - 10 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- drink, eat - 16 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- fear, crouch - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- lie, sleep - 15 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;

If you have any other questions or need help, write me an e-mail: RedDeer3D@gmail.com

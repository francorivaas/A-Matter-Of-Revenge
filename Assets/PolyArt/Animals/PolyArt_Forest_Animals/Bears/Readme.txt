Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
 Animator is missing. 
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- drink, crouch, eat, sleep - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- stand - 25 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- lie - 30 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
If you have any other questions or need help, write me an e-mail: RedDeer3d@gmail.com

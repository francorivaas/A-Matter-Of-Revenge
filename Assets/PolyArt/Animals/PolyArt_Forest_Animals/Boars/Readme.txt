Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
  
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- lie, sleep - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- eat, drink - 15 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;

The animator controller is missing.
